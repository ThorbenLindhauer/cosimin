cosimin - Cosine Similarity Index
=================================

Cosimin creates indexing structures that allow to efficiently search by similarity in large amounts of vectors. For example, it can be used as the core of a content-based recommendation system.

Cosimin implements a locality-sensitive hashing technique proposed in the following publication ([online](http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/people/hovy/papers/05ACL-clustering.pdf)):
